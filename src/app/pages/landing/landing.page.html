        <h2>OUR ORIGINS</h2>
        <p>
          NEW CROWN Service Partners NV was founded in October 2017 by two former employees and acquired the
          intellectual property and trade fund of CROWN-BAELE. This makes NEW CROWN the sole official original
          manufacturer of CROWN-BAELE parts and assemblies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name NEW CROWN was chosen to mark the inseparable connection with the history of its illustrious
          predecessor yet indicating a new business model and ambition in becoming the reference for upgrading older
          equipment in the global RGB industry.
