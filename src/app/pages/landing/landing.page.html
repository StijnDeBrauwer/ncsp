        <h2>The origins of the crown</h2>
        <p>
          NEW CROWN Service Partners NV was founded in October 2017 by two
          former employees and acquired the intellectual property and trade fund
          of CROWN-BAELE, who was declared bankrupt a month before. This makes
          NEW CROWN the sole official OEM of CROWN-BAELE parts and assemblies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The name NEW CROWN was chosen to mark the inseparable connection with
          the history of its illustrious predecessor yet indicating a new
          business model and ambition in becoming the reference for upgrading
          older equipment in the global RGB industry.
