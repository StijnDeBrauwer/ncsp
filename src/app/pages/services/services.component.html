        <h2>MAINTENANCE</h2>
        <p>
          In order to keep a machine in good working order, it is not sufficient
          to make a revision once or twice a year. Maintenance is a daily duty.
          During our interventions we always take the time to give your people a
          thorough explanation about the maintenance required and explain to
          them what needs to be done and when. By always doing this with your
          people hands-on, we do not only teach them what to do, but they also
          understand why, and what the consequences of the lack of maintenance
          can be.

        <h2>SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS</h2>
        <p>
          We are happy to be your committed service partner. Joining up with NEW
          CROWN, you are not only sure of our professional services, but we know
          the industry and have the flexibility when dates change or production
          delays. After a period of exploration, we put together objectives that
          we constantly monitor using carefully chosen KPIs. Service and
          material costs are then included in the agreement. So you can
          perfectly project your costs in short and long term, for the machines
          you entrust to us.

        <h2>Fast and flexible</h2>
        <p>
          Thanks to our light company structure and short lines of
          communication, we can come in very quickly. By communicating
          intensively with our customers we can act very flexibly, and we always
          find an appropriate solution for your planned and unplanned
          interventions.

        <h2>LOCAL PARTNERS</h2>
        <p>
          We are also always building on an international network of partners,
          so that we can quickly and efficiently provide first-line service in
          difficult-to-reach areas, without the burdens that international
          travel entails, such as the Obtaining a visa, or an expensive flight.
          Our local partners are also always involved in interventions in their
          areas, with which we can not only reduce the costs for you, but
          therefore they enjoy specific training for your needs, and can then
          also provide the appropriate service. In addition, in many cases our
          local partners also offer the possibility to act in local currency,
          which is certainly an additional asset.
